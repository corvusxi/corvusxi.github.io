<h1>Phase 1</h1>
<p>My path to data science begins with my background in both Graphic Design and User Experience, and decided the field would be an excellent compliment for my career path. It is, and I continue it hopes to be, an excellent challenge as well. Visuals and user interfaces are my current strengths. From that, I understand users from qualitative standpoint through user interviews and creating personas. Quantitative data is a new field for me, and the large set of information would be great for the user research branch. Near or after the completion of this course, I’d like to bring that data into Tableau, or learn Power Bi.</p>

<p>One of my initial challenges is that I often feel that my time management skill needs incredible improvement with my full schedule for this 15 week course. I’d really like to establish learning habits for certification success. On productive days, this can include:
    <ul><li>Watch at least one relevant video on LinkedIn Learning.
      <li>Study at least one Python informative on the O'Reilly website. Currently, it's the book Head First Python by Paul Barry.
        <li>Clear one step in the freeCodeCamp Data Analysis With Python course.
          <li>Earn the daily 250XP in DataCamp.</li></ul>
  </p>
<p>In an overlap in an interest to pick up mathematics books and to prepare for this course, I also started reading from the Very Short Introduction series from Oxford University Press. Earlier this year, my first book was Mathematics by Timothy Gowers. Next, The History of Mathematics by Jacqueline Stedall. Then, I read Statistics by David J. Hand. Currently, my commute book is Numbers by Peter M. Higgins.</p>
<p>Another challenge is planning ahead for my capstone project. I am siding towards the infrastructure of New York City as I was inspired by the book Streetfight by Janette Sadik-Khan. She was the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation from 2007–2013 under Mayor Michael Bloomberg. I was also inspired by a 2021 article on Curbed about Perfecting the New York Street. Safety for pedestrians and bicyclists is important to me, as well as improving public transit, for a more efficient city.</p>
<p>As a minute project as a challenge, the CSS of this web design needs a lot of refining. Hope my habit of ending lines in VS Code with semicolons does not return.</p>
